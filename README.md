# ECE387_SOS_LED
this code is about using an led to show "SOS" in morse code 
there is a led connects to pin 13 and a 100ohm resistor

original code from https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/hussiencasper/morse-code-s-o-s-9d8377?f=1 

this code create a flashing function to do the action (pinMode,HIGH)-delay-(pinMode,LOW)
I think it is better than repeat pinmode-delay in the code many times
